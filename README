Cross-platform detection and functionality encapsulation for EnyoJS (1.0).

Include EnyoPlatform.js within your depends.js as any other source file. Preferably include it first,
so that it is loaded before any other code.  If you are using PhoneGap/Cordova, and not waiting until "deviceready" to
start loading, you want to make sure not to call most of the functions in here until after the "deviceready" event
is fired. Assumes presence of PhoneGap for Android and iOS functionality.

You do not need to instance the Platform Kind.

Platform - basic platform determination and utility functions

    Platform.getPlatformName() - return a string containing the name of the platform where available
    Platform.isWebOS() - true if WebOS
    Platform.isAndroid() - true if Android
    Platform.isBlackBerry() - true if BlackBerry or WebWorks/BlackBerry
    Platform.isiOS() - true if iOS
    Platform.isMobile - true if not a "web" platform

    Platform.hasFlash() - true if platform is known to likely carry Flash in it's WebViews
    
    Platform.isLargeScreen() - arbitrary value, I use px > 480 wide to assume we're on a tablet
    Platform.isWideScreen() - true if screen is wider than tall (ie, Portrait mode)

    Platform.hasBack() - true if platform is known to have a universal "Back" button or gesture
    Platform.hasMenu() - true if platform is known to have a universal "Menu" button or gesture
    Platform.useHTMLAudio() - true if platform is known to have a -FUNCTIONAL- HTML Audio implementation
                              (Android 2 does NOT, I have not tested other Androids)
    
    Platform.browser(url, thisObj) - returns a function that can be called to launch a browser. Use such as:
                                     Platform.browser("http://some.url", this)(); Make sure you call the function
				     returned by this function.
    Platform.getReviewURL() - return a URL formatted to fit the app store for whatever platform we are detected on.
                              Currently supports WebOS, Android, BlackBerry PlayBook, iOS.
			      Define additional variables in your appinfo.json as helpers:
			      appWorldId: Your BlackBerry App World id in the URL from the dev portal
			      iTunesAppId: Your iTunes App Id

PlatformSound - overrides enyo.Sound to encapsulate the PhoneGap media API within it for use on platforms such as
                Android 2 that do not properly support the HTML5 Audio API.  Instance this kind when needed, or
		place it in your app's components where needed.

    play() - start playback, restart playback if already playing
    getCurrentPosition() - return current playback position
    getDuration() - return loaded media duration
    pause() - toggle pause state of playback
    release() - completely destroy this component, and release any resources it was using in PhoneGap
    seekTo(seconds) - jump to the specified playback position
    stop() - completely stop playback
